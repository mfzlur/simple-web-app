    <h1>Data Science Tools and Their Importance</h1>
    <h2>1. Python</h2>
    <p>Importance: Python is widely used for data analysis and machine learning due to its simplicity and vast libraries.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: Python can be slower compared to other programming languages like C++.</p>

    <h2>2. R</h2>
    <p>Importance: R is great for statistical analysis and visualization, widely used in academia.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: It has a steeper learning curve and less efficiency for large-scale machine learning tasks.</p>

    <h2>3. SQL</h2>
    <p>Importance: SQL is essential for querying and managing large datasets in databases.</p>
    <p>Disadvantages: Not suitable for handling complex data analysis compared to Python or R.</p>
